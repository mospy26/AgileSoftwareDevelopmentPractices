# Agile-Software-Project---1
This is the work for Agile Software Development Project - Group 1

To build, test and run, first clone the repository and:
- Run "gradle clean" to remove leftover files from old builds
- Run "gradle build" to build the program
- Run "gradle test" to run test cases
- Run "gradle run" to run the program

You may have to do additional steps if you're using an IDE. Also note that when writing test cases, you must run "gradle clean" before retesting to ensure that the test files are updated.

When you've run the calculator, it will expect input in the form "A op B", where A and B are numbers and op is an operator, such as * for multiplication. Some examples:

```
5 * 4.1
2 ^ 3
8 / 2
2.5 + 1
3 - 9.23
```
